# Process Dumper
Process Dumper: A graphical user interface tool for dumping random process memory using MiniDumpWriteDump, excluding any PPPL (Protected Process Light) Process.

## How to Use:

1. Enter the Process ID of the process that has to be dumped.
2. To produce a memory dump file of the process, click the "Dump Process" button.
3. The dump file will be stored in the directory Public Documents.

### This is simply an attempt to understand different WINAPI use cases and a little GUI programming. Because I'm a total rookie with C++ GUI, most of the gui code is provided by Microsoft Visual Studio, so I attempted to grasp it and change it to fit my needs. If you have any feedback, please share it with me as it will help me progress.
